# Laurine Example 

**I find most of the examples boring**. This is why I decided to build **full-fledged** application as example. It contains all you would expect from real application - UI, network, logic.. but also localizations and configured laurine generator. 

If you would like to use any part of the project for your personal projects, or use it as template if you are just starting with development, you are very welcome to do that. 

Example uses pods which are checked in, so please **open Laurine.xcworkspace** instead of .xcodeproj.

> If you do fullsearch for `.Localizations`, you will find all the tricks in the code.


## Love for contributors!

The example is connected to GitHub open API and feeds the data in real-time. I made the example so it lists all the contributors to this repository. **It is basically Hall of Fame**. If you want to be in, lets build the best library together.

## Sneakpeek

There is another library / tool that I am releasing in very near future (definitely before christmas), if you want to get idea about what it is, go to Classes/Model/Objects and see the beauty.
